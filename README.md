## Service microservice

The Service microservice features three main models: Technician, AutomobileVo, and Appointment. Although there is an AutomobileVO model that includes a "vin" field within my models file, this field isn't linked as a Foreign Key to the "vin" field in the Appointment model. Within the service directory, there's a subdirectory named "poll," which contains a file called 'poller.py.' This file contains the logic for fetching necessary data (vin and sold fields) from the inventory microservice.

The primary goal of the Service microservice is to keep track of technicians, oversee the status of service appointments, and manage a service history record, enabling searches for appointments using a vehicle's vin number. Furthermore, it enhances functionality by allowing the addition of new technicians and providing an appointment scheduling form to streamline the process of setting up new appointments.
